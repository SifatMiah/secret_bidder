# 🏆 Secret Auction Program

A simple command-line bidding system where users can enter their name and bid amount. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder is announced!

## 📋 How It Works

1. Each participant is prompted to enter:
   - Their **name**
   - Their **bid amount**

2. After each bid, the program asks whether another person wants to bid.
   - If `yes`, the screen is "cleared" and the next bidder enters their information.
   - If `no`, the auction ends and the highest bidder is announced.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

### Running the Program

1. Make sure you have a file named `art.py` with the following line:
   ```python
   art_a = """
     _____           _   _             _   _             
    / ____|         | | (_)           | | (_)            
   | (___  _   _ ___| |_ _  ___  _ __ | |_ _  ___  _ __  
    \___ \| | | / __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \| __| |/ _ \| '_ \ 
    ____) | |_| \__ \ |_| | (_) | | | | |_| | (_) | | | |
   |_____/ \__, |___/\__|_|\___/|_| |_|\__|_|\___/|_| |_|
            __/ |                                        
           |___/                                         
   """
